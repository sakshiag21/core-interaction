      <p>Conde Nast Traveler is a luxury and lifestyle travel magazine published by Conde Nast. It has a motto of "Truth in Travel". The latest cover and project direction was lead by, In-house (Matt Willey, Hitomi Sati, Rami Moghadam, and Lea Jafiarova; New York, NY) and the logo by Henrik Kubel (London).
      </p>

      <p>
      The redesigned new logo shows how it takes 6% less space, giving more space in the cover of the magazine to portray visual imagination to attract attention. The new logo is a beautiful serif with very high contrast and an unexpected ball terminal ligature between the "r" and "a" - most likely the first of its kind!</p>

      <blockquote>They also realized that the change forced them to ask deeper questions about who they were and what, exactly, should be the role of the magazine (or any travel publication, for that matter) in the age of Instagram and TripAdvisor, when so little is left to the imagination.</blockquote></div>
      <p> They believe it is their job to keep that travel dream-state alive and well between journeys-to bring into focus that sense of how it might feel to walk the street markets of Oaxaca, for example-by providing a sketch, if not a fully. The magazine tries to shape nostalgia, thinking and a particular feel about a place. It shows the power of travel to change our perspective. The design and the layout of the magazine is extremely clean and clear. It also keeps a balance between the traditional and modern, showing the thrill of the new and the pleasures of the tried and tested experiences.</p>
