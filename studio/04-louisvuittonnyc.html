    <p class="gradient">The Louis Vuitton Travel Book collection offers a new and contemporary vision of travel, both real and virtual. Intended as works of art in themselves, they depict each destination through the eyes of an artist in 100-120 exclusive drawings. The Travel Book New York by French artist and blogger Jean-Philippe Delhomme offers a colorful and humorous vision of the Big Apple.
      <br><br>
    Placing emphasis on popular cities, as much as far-flung locations, the inaugural global tour kicks off with four vibrant locales, one of them being New York. Familiar and unexpected scenes are depicted with equal creative flourish.
      <br><br>
    Jean-Philippe Delhomme is an illustrator, who put brush to paper to show his vision of New York. He shared with us his favourite haunts, along with insight on what continues to make it the destination of choice for millions, year after year. His passion for travel and working on different projects and clients in New York since the mid-1900s, having done several advertising campaigns. He has always been inspired by the city. He also talks about the incredible light. And of course, the tremendous variety of people and characters.
      <br><br>
    The most impressive thing for him as an artist in New York was a sharp and violent light - and its shadows. There's also a certain melancholy and loneliness to New York that he likes, and the sense that things are miraculously suspended in time but eroded by the weather. The city is a poetic space, and not just a global shopping experience. The challenge for him was to revisit and find places that he still found poetic and inspirational. Each chapter is dedicated to a district in the city, such as Central Park, where Delhomme painted everyday scenes such as horse carriages and runners passing through the park.</p>
