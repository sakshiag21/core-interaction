      <p>Boat Magazine is an independent travel and culture publication that focusses on a different, inspiring city for each issue. From Sarajevo to Reykjavik to Lima, Boat Magazine shines a different kind of light on cities with big stories to tell.
        <br><br>
      For each issue, they set up studios in the focus city, working with locals to create the content. The locals get to decide what they want the world to know about their city. The editor of the magazine even said,<p>
      <blockquote >We work day and night to uncover stories that don't usually get told.</blockquote>

         <p class="gradient">This inside/outside approach to a city keeps the perspectives varied and balanced and the overall content raw and often surprising. Digging deep in each city, Boat Magazine presents gritty, honest, inspiring editorial through interviews, features, stunning photography, personal profiles, artwork and fiction.
         <br><br>
      For its Seventh issue the entire masthead and overall art direction of the magazine was redesigned and rethought. The aim of the new masthead was to create something that was not only recognisable, but confident as a brand mark. Previously, the magazines title was more discreet in a 'luggage tag' masthead. The brand refresh readdressed this by celebrating it's unique name and bringing it to the forefront-making it an own-able and distinguishable asset.</p>

  <caption><h3>Issue Two - See it Through (boat magazine)</h3>Boat Magazine is a bi-annual publication that moves to cities with big stories to tell. We went to Detroit to create our second issue.

Photographer / Film maker Jonathan Cherry spent a week capturing the spirit of the city. Set to a poem by Edgar Albert Guest, resident of Detroit in the early 20th century and Michigan's only Poet Laureate.
