          <h1>TO TRAVEL IS TO LIVE</h1>
          <P>I want to explore the idea of travelling. My personal experience of travelling around the globe from East to West and North to South make me want to navigate through in an imaginary world. I want to look at the ideas of magazine, layouts, books, editorial and publishing. How the idea of travel is laid out in an interesting way. At the same time, it excites me learn more about the places that I have not been to. Its specialities, cultures and the uniqueness. Trying to understand the same approach of printing and branding by different companies and their own special uniqueness in assembling the gathered information.</P>
